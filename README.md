traj is a collection of utility classes for experimenting with analyzing spatial trajectories.

As of now, the raw data I use as input is the GeoLife database.

The ```./data/``` directory is the place to put all of the required input data for this code to work.  Specifically, you put the GeoLife database of example coordinates.
